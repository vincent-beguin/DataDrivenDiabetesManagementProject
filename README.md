# DataDrivenDiabetesManagementProject
Semester Project for the course Data Driven Diabetes Management. Group of Amir Meymandinezhad, Hamidreza Madi and Vincent BÃ©guin. Project number 8

## Introduction
This project aims to evaluate different Machine learning methodologies to predict Type II diabetes from normal routine health data among Pima Indian women over 21 who've already had a pregnancy. The Pima Indians Diabetes Database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) was used as training dataset.

## Methodology
six machine learning models were used:
* Logistic Regression
* Random forest
* FNN
* XGBoost
* CatBoost
* LightGBM

Preprossessing was applied when necessary. The first three models were used with data imputation and tested with and without normalisation and SMOTE. The latter three models didn't require any preprocessing.

## Running the software
The provided codebase has been developed using Python 3.12.8. Before running the scripts, ensure all dependencies are installed by executing the requirements.txt file. Each model has its own dedicated script, named after the corresponding model for clarity and ease of use. Additionally, a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook is included, which contains the fully executed code, showcasing the complete workflow. Before running the scripts, verify and update the file path directories as needed to ensure compatibility with your local environment.
